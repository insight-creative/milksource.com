Nearly $11,000 in college scholarships has been awarded to 13 students through the 2017 Milk Source Employee Family Scholarship program. Employees, their spouses or their children are eligible to apply for the scholarships, which have awarded nearly $35,000 in just three years. Students at five different UW Campuses, Fox Valley Technical College and colleges in Michigan, Kansas and Georgia all received awards this year. “We are committed to helping our employees and their families get a strong education and help strengthen their families,” said Milk Source Partner Todd Willer, who along with co-partners John Vosters and Jim Ostrom all completed their education at UW-Madison in the 1990s shortly before forming their partnership. Those who received scholarships from the program this year are: Maylene Beltran, Brice Clark, Alexis Duarte, Jonathan Duarte, Yael Gracia, Hailey Haen, Juan M. Moreno Meraz, Estephania Vargas Montoya, Ermith Ocampo, Daisy Quintero, Oscar Perez Sanchez, Gina Schmlaz and Sam Stern.
