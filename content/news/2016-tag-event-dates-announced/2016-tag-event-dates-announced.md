The MilkSource Genetics Tag Event of Champions will take place March 25-26, at our farm, N3763 Vanden Bosch Road, Kaukauna, WI

We look forward to continuing our tradition of having a great time while selling great cows as well as adding new elements to benefit the next generation of dairy leaders.

And fret not, fans of the NCAA March Madness Tournament: We'll have screens and viewing areas designated so you can watch your favorite teams when you're not looking at beautiful cows!
