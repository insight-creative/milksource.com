      body: "Milk Source was founded in 1994 by Jim Ostrom, John Vosters and Todd Willer, each from multi-generational Wisconsin farm families. A small 30-cow dairy started in 1965 by John’s parents in Freedom has evolved into a family of farms across Wisconsin and the Midwest."
    - heading: Environment
      icon: /uploads/sustainability-white.svg
      body: "Our credo is “Sustainability Starts Here,” and we walk our talk. “Sustainability” remains both a goal and a process, encompassing superior environmental management, wildlife protection, herd health, food safety, resource conservation and more."

    Milk Source farms strive to be good neighbors in our hometowns. We work
    alongside local food pantries, service groups, emergency service providers
    and other organizations to ensure the continued vitality of our communities.
    We foster agricultural transparency by offering free tours to our neighbors,
    local residents and their guests as well as sponsoring larger-scale public
    events, such as our annual “Salute to Dairy Nights” with Minor League
    Baseball’s Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.
