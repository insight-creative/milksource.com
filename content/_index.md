      body: "Milk Source was founded in 1994 by Jim Ostrom, John Vosters and Todd Willer, each from multi-generational Wisconsin farm families. A small 30-cow dairy started in 1965 by John’s parents in Freedom has evolved into a family of farms across Wisconsin and the Midwest."
    - heading: Environment
      icon: /uploads/sustainability-white.svg
      body: "Our credo is “Sustainability Starts Here,” and we walk our talk. “Sustainability” remains both a goal and a process, encompassing superior environmental management, wildlife protection, herd health, food safety, resource conservation and more."
