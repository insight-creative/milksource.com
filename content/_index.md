  body: >-
    <p>Milk Source farms strive to be good neighbors in our hometowns. We work
    alongside local food pantries, service groups, emergency service providers
    and other organizations to ensure the continued vitality of our communities.
    We foster agricultural transparency by offering free tours to our neighbors,
    local residents and their guests as well as sponsoring larger-scale public
    events, such as our annual “Salute to Cows Nights” with Minor League
    Baseball’s Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.</p>
