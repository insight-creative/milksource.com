  heading: Protecting and replenishing our planet
  body: Everything that we need for our survival and well-being depends, either directly or indirectly, on our natural environment. Sustainability creates and maintains the conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the social, economic and other requirements of present and future generations.

  heading: Involved in our communities where we live and work
  body: Milk Source farms strive to be good neighbors in our hometowns. We work alongside local food pantries, service groups, emergency service providers and other organizations to ensure the continued vitality of our communities. We foster agricultural transparency by offering free tours to our neighbors, local residents and their guests as well as sponsoring larger-scale public events, such as our annual “Salute to Cows Nights” with Minor League Baseball’s Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.
