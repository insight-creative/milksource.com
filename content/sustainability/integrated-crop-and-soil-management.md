* Natural fertilizer reduces need for chemicals
* 25,000 acres+ of farm land under NMP
* Crop rotation prevents erosion and soil loss  
* All of the farms have zero runoff
* Tilth of soil enhanced by manure fertilizer  
* Manure is tested before spreading
* Soil testing monitors nutrient levels  
* Dairies built on existing farmland
* Alfalfa fields control erosion  
* NMPs include thousands of pages of the best practices
