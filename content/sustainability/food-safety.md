## Producing the freshest and safest product.

**Keys to Food Safety**

* At  Milk Source, we believe that cows need a variety of ingredients in  their feed in order to meet their full nutritional needs and produce the  most milk.
* We house our animals indoors with cooling systems in order to keep them cool and producing the most and safest milk.
* Our calves are vaccinated soon after birth and separated from the mature cows in order to prevent infections as calves are not born with strong immune systems.
* All milk and meat from the farms are tested for pathogens prior to processing to ensure food safety
* If one of our cows becomes ill, they are immediately treated in our on-site hospitals, just like a human would receive medicine when they are sick. Sick cows are not milked with the rest of the herd. Their milk is kept separate and is not for human consumption.
