    <p>At Whistler&rsquo;s run, we see all creatures as equals. Every living
    being deserves respect and understanding and that principle is what guides
    our barn practices and training philosophy.</p>

    <p>We believe horses should be horses&mdash;not unfeeling objects to use at
    our disposal and that philosophy carries through to each of the creatures in
    our care.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re committed to using a natural
    horsemanship and animal husbandry approach to care for and train the horses
    and other animals here at Whistler&rsquo;s Run, both personal and
    boarded.</p><p>What does that look like?</p><ul><li>Ample turnout time
    daily</li><li>No pack-leader mentality</li><li>Connection before
    correction</li><li>Gentle care and training tactics</li></ul><p>While we
    understand that every boarder will have a slightly different approach to
    caring for and training their animals, any aggressive or potentially harmful
    treatment of horses or other animals at Whistler&rsquo;s Run will
    <em>never</em> be tolerated.</p>

    <p>Our top priority is ensuring the animals in our care are happy,
    comfortable and safe. You’ll never have to worry about your horse (or any of
    our animals) sitting alone, injured or stressed.</p>

    <h3>Our care and safety measures:</h3>

    <ul> <li>Daily turnout with ample time and space to roam and graze</li>
    <li>Hay and Tribute feed with top dressing given daily</li> <li>Multiple
    pastures and pens to pair animals of similar temperament and size</li>
    <li>Blanketing, heated barn and rubber stall mats for Wisconsin winters</li>
    <li>Close monitoring of physical and mental health</li> <li>All the love and
    attention we can give!</li> </ul>
