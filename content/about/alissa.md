        <p>A weanling Mini Gypsy Vanner purchased from <a href="http://www.minihoofbeats.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollower">Mini Hoof Beats</a> in Neenah, WI, Percy is a young gelding curious about everything! He explores and learns something new every day and loves feeling like a big boy by hanging out in the pasture with one of his best horse friends, Dawson.</p>

    - heading: Griffin
      body: >
        <p>Make sure you say hello to this happy-go-lucky Golden Lab mix if you see him on his frequent romps around the property! Though Griffin was found dumped in a culvert by a breeding facility before ending up with Alissa, he doesn’t let his past define him now that he’s found his forever home.</p>

        <p>When he’s not treating Whistler’s Run like his own personal playground, Griffin is always excited to greet visitors with a smile (and perhaps an excited jump or two) and get in some quality scratches before heading off to play with his other four-legged friends.</p>

        <p>Don’t let her name fool you—though this English Springer Spaniel rescue is as gorgeous as they come, she sure isn’t afraid to take charge and get her paws dirty! After getting kicked out of her former home for being a bully, Pippa found her perfect life purpose: bossing around the other dogs. She keeps everyone in line and never turns down a snack for all her hard work.</p>

    - heading: Gus
      body: >
        <p>This 10-year-old Golden Lab rescue is one of the more reserved animals in Alissa’s pack. Though he’s usually a bit fearful and anxious on the outside, he secretly loves everyone. Gus makes sure everyone knows he’s tough by greeting visitors with a bark, but he warms up quickly (so long as you have some treats or scratches to share).</p>

      body: >
        <p>You’re not seeing double—this 10-year-old Golden Lab rescue is Gus’ litter-mate! Rufus is the cool, relaxed brother (compared to the more anxious Gus) who brings a sense of calm to any situation. He wants nothing more than to stare into your eyes and bring you love … what could be better?</p>

Alissa founded Whistler’s Run along with her sister Lauren after working for 15 years as a psychology professor and family counselor. At the barn, Alissa focuses on growing a unique, personal relationship rooted in trust and consistency with each animal.

Alissa passionately advocates for the due rights of every soul at Whistler’s Run, including intellectual stimulation, physical exploration within a natural environment and having a “voice and choice” whenever possible in their daily existence.

Alissa also believes animals have quite a bit to teach people about the meaning of humanity and wakes up each day eager to learn more about what they are ready to share. Alissa looks forward to welcoming various populations to Whistler’s Run for educational and wellness experiences.
