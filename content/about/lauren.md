    - heading: Remini (Remi)
      body: >
        <p>Standing at over 17 hands in height, this Shire mare is a massive beauty … but don’t let her size fool you! She’s as gentle as they come. Remi is the first horse Lauren purchased after acquiring Whistler’s Run, with Remi’s daughter Saoirse arriving shortly after.</p>

    - heading: Saoirse
      body: >
        <p>This Shire mare is only a year old and already giving her mom a run for her money in size! Already nearly as tall as Remi (over 17 hands), Saoirse is like a massive toddler in horse form. She’s a bundle of playful, curious energy and loves following her mom around the pasture.</p>

    - heading: Prada
      body: >
        <p>Purchased for Lauren’s daughter Isla from <a href="http://www.minihoofbeats.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollower">Mini Hoof Beats</a> in Neenah, WI, Prada is a six-year-old Mini Gypsy mare who lives up to the breed’s gentle reputation.</p>

        <p>Known as the Golden Retrievers of the horse community, Prada fits the bill as a super chill cream puff (who could stand to lose a few extra pounds) who just loves to be loved, though she doesn’t let that stop her from bossing around the other horses as the Mafia Don of the farm.</p>

    - heading: Freya
      body: >
        <p>Lauren rescued this four-year-old Gypsy Vanner mare from a starvation situation. While Freya is a total lovebug, she is still unaccustomed to human touch. Lauren is working hard to give Freya all the love this sweet girl missed out on for the first four years of her life and Freya continues to put in the hard work of learning to trust her human caretakers.</p>

    - heading: Dawson
      body: >
        <p>Dawson is a handsome, 13-year-old Percheron gelding currently learning to drive a cart. He’s as kind as they come, loves human attention and gets along with all his pasture mates, especially Percy, the baby of the group.</p>

    - heading: Wilbur
      body: >
        <p>Also known as Lauren’s third child, Wilbur is a two-year-old English Bulldog who loves to explore Whistler’s Run from his unique (short) vantage point. Wilbur is as loyal as they come and is particularly good at being Lauren’s shadow. Wherever Lauren is, Wilbur is always close behind!</p>

    - heading: Moose
      body: >
        <p>You might not see this six-year-old Newfoundland around Whistler’s too often, but he sure does make a statement wherever he goes! Moose is a big, furry guy whose favorite pastime at the barn is sleeping in the middle of the aisle, especially when all the horses are about to come back in.</p>

    - heading: Whistler
      body: >
        <p>The namesake of Whistler’s Run, this one-year-old Newfoundland is a big floof of love and fur. Whistler loves stopping by and checking on his namesake as much as possible, especially if he can get the chance to take a dip in one of the horse water barrels, one of his favorite pastimes on the farm.</p>

      body: >
        <p>The shy dog of the group, Rosie is an independent girl who loves to run in the hay field. She’s also fond of mothering all the boy dogs, even though she’s just six years old.</p>

Lauren purchased Whistler's Run in May of 2022 in a bold departure from her former career as CEO of CorLife, LLC, a prior business that she recently sold. She owns and operates the barn with her sister [Alissa](/about/alissa/), as well as her husband Nate and their four dogs.

Though working with horses wasn’t her focus for the first part of her career, Lauren has loved and had a passion for animals her entire life. She is an advocate of animal rescue and supports various animal rescues and other organizations throughout the U.S. in addition to caring for the rescue animals at the barn.

In founding Whistler’s Run, Lauren’s main goal has always been to provide the safest and most comfortable environment for the animals who call Whistler’s Run home. She has truly found her passion here at the barn and loves getting to know and learn from her boarders and barn visitors.

You can usually find Lauren spending time at the barn, passing out snacks and spending quality time with the horses, as well as simply enjoying the peace and tranquility Whistler’s Run has to offer.
