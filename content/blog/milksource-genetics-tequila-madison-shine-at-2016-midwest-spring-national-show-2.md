MilkSource Genetics’ [Strans-Jen-D Tequila-RED-ET](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Strans-Jen-D-Tequila-Red-ET-EX-95/p/40102059/category=3514356) captured back-to-back Grand Championships at the Midwest Spring National Show 2016. She captured the top honor in the Red & White competition and followed up with the same prize a day later in the Holstein show.

“She’s an extremely incredible cow,” said MilkSource Genetics Partner Jim Ostrom. “She’s the kind of cow people will talk about for a generation … She commands a presence in the ring. It’s an honor to work with her.”

She was not alone in the victory circle: Barn mate [Edgebrook Tequila Madison-ET](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Edgebrook-Tequila-Madison-VG-89/p/44719149/category=3514356) won the Grand Championship in the Jersey Cow competition. “She lit it up, she did terrific. And rightfully so, because here we are in Madison, Wisconsin,” joked MilkSource Genetics Partner Jim Ostrom.

MilkSource Genetics was named Premier Exhibitor & Breeder of the R&W Show as well as Premier Exhibitor of the Jersey Show.
