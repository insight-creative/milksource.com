She captured the top honor in the Red & White competition and followed up with the same prize a day later in the Holstein show. She was not alone in the victory circle: Barn mate [Edgebrook Tequila Madison-ET](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Edgebrook-Tequila-Madison-VG-89/p/44719149/category=3514356) won the Grand Championship in the Jersey Cow competition. "(Tequila's) an extremely incredible cow," said MilkSource Genetics Partner Jim Ostrom. "She's the kind of cow people will talk about for a generation … She commands a presence in the ring. It’s an honor to work with her."
