Milk Source has been named among the 2015 "Green Masters" honorees by the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council.

The Green Masters Program is a recognition and assessment program for Wisconsin businesses interested in improvingÂ their sustainability initiatives. The objective of the Green Masters Program is to provide companies with a benchmark for themselves as well as the ability to compare their sustainability performance to other companies in their sector.

"Sustainability isn't a one-and-done proposition," said Milk Source Partner Todd Willer , who accepted the award alongside Milk Source Environmental Coordinator Sarah Babcock. "Every day, we are looking at the best practices and technologies in order to improve our stewardship of natural resources. This is a continuous improvement undertaking."

The Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council is a network of Wisconsin businesses and organizations that are interested in, or actively responding to, the challenge of sustainability. Many businesses find themselves challenged by stakeholders to describe what they are doing in this field. The council is designed to bring businesses together and provide resources to help businesses on their path toward being more sustainable.

"We seek to recognize businesses and help them to distinguish themselves from their peers," said Tom Eggert, executive director of the council, during the annual conference at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh.
