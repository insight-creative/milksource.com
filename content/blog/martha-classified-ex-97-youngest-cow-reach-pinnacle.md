KAUKAUNA – Musqie Iatola Martha has achieved what only six Jersey cows before her have been able to; and that's to establish herself as one of the most elite cows of her breed — around the world.

And at age of six, this northeast Wisconsin bovine beauty is the youngest cow to write that page in the official record books.

The American Jersey Cattle Association, the organization that officially determines the overall quality of the cow, today upgraded six year old Martha to the elite EX-97 score, making her the seventh Jersey in history to reach that pinnacle. There is no higher score.

The decision culminates a historic, three-year run in international show cow competitions during which Martha was named a three-time consecutive Royal Agricultural Winter Fair Supreme Champion, two time World Dairy Expo Reserve Supreme Champion and WDE Supreme Champion.

“I have said it before and I’ll say again, Martha is a ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ cow. I could spend the rest of my life trying to find an animal as amazing as her, and I wouldn’t succeed,” said Jim Ostrom, a partner in MilkSource Genetics, which co-owns Martha with Guatemalan businessman Fernando Jarquin.

In another first, Martha became the youngest cow — of any breed — to achieve that score.

In 2014, MilkSource Genetics made history when another cow — Blondin Redman Seisme — became the first Red & White Holstein cow ever to achieve an EX-97 score.

“It’s unbelievably rare and just as spectacular,” said MSG Partner John Vosters. “This feels like lightning striking twice.”

In recent years, more than 10,000 guests — including visitors from every continent except Antarctica — visited MilkSource Genetics with the intention of seeing Martha in person. Her international reputation has earned her the nickname “The People’s Champion.”

“This score reflects the professionalism and personal passion of MilkSource Genetics Herd Manager Eddie Bue, his wife and partner-in-cow-care, Mandi, and their entire team,” Ostrom said. “It is a privilege to work with them.”

To put Martha’s achievement into more accessible terms, she is to show cows what Hank Aaron was to baseball and Secretariat was to horse racing. “Simply stated, one of the best ever,” Vosters said.
