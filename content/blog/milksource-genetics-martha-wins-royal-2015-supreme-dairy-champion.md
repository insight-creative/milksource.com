Musquie Iatola Martha has followed her Grand Champion appearance at World Dairy Expo by climbing to the next level at The Royal Agricultural Winter Fair 2015.

The MilkSource Genetics' Jersey won Supreme Dairy Champion honors at The Royal 2015.

The Royal marked the second consecutive show where more than one MilkSource cow earned Grand Champion honors. Martha was joined in the Parade of Champions by barn mate, Charwill Attic Marcy, who took top honors in the Holstein breed.

"This is unbelievable," said Jim Ostrom, MilkSource Genetics partner, when Martha grabbed the highest award. " To have two chances in this competition is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. But there's only one cow standing out there now, and it's Martha."

Under the day-to-day leadership of Herd Manager Jamie Endvick, MilkSource Genetics earned several top honors:

- Premier Exhibitor of the Holstein Show
- Gaemenchet Sid Katia was Honorable Mention Intermediate Champion
- Lovhill Goldwyn Katrysha was 2nd Mature Cow
- Marcy, Weeks Dundee Anika and Strans-Jen-D Tequila were first, second and third, respectively, in the 4 Year Old class.

"This doesn't happen without a great team," said John Vosters, MilkSource Genetics partner. "Our herdsmen and women are among the best in the world at what they do. And we couldn't be prouder of them."
