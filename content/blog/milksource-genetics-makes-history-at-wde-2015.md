Cows from MilkSource Genetics of Freedom, Wis., not only won the Supreme Champion and Reserve Supreme Champion awards at the 2015 World Dairy Expo in Madison, WI, but they made history in the process.

Never before have three different breeds from the same farm captured Grand Champion honors in their respective classes. The unprecedented Triple Crown achievement was earned by Holstein cow Lovhill Goldwyn Katrysha (who went on to become Supreme Champ); Jersey cow, Musquie Iatola Martha-ET (named Reserve Supreme Champ); and Red & White Holstein Strans-Jen-D Tequila.

MilkSource Genetics also was named Premier Exhibitor and Premier Breeder of the Red & White Show as well as Premier Exhibitor of the Holstein Show.

“We are just completely humbled,” said Jim Ostrom, MilkSource Genetics Partner. “We know so many people in the industry who have worked so hard every day of the year for decades, and to accomplish what we accomplished is unbelievable, really.”

“The people on our team made it all happen,” echoed Partner John Vosters. “We owe them a tremendous amount of gratitude for their hard work, and their passion for these spectacular animals.”

Under the day-to-day leadership of Herd Manager Jamie Endvick, MilkSource Genetics cows also captured top or first-place honors in more than a dozen breed categories, among them:

- Rokey-Benfer R Cutie-Red-ET was named the Red & White Show’s Honorable Mention Grand Champion as well as the International Futurity Champion.
- Milksource Wire Racket-Red won Reserve Junior Champion of the R&W Show.
- Brackleyfarm Chelios Cheerio took Honorable Mention Grand Champion of the Holstein Show as well as 1st place in the highly competitive 4 Year Old class. (In addition, she competed against four of her farm sisters, two of which finished in the Top Ten as well.)

“Three breed champions coming from the same farm has never happened before — and none of this would be possible without great team work and the people at home that work with these animals every day,” Endvick said.

Just a year shy of its 50th anniversary, this year’s Expo attracted about 80,000 guests to Madison as well as more than 2,500 of North America’s top-quality cattle, representing seven major dairy breeds.

“While the motivations for coming here are as different as the individual Expo-goers, there appears to be a common thread among everyone who passes through the gates,” said Scott Bentley, WDE’s general manager. “They all share a deeply seated love for the dairy industry.”

Before heading off to The Royal Winter Fair in Ontario, Canada, next month, Ostrom said Team MilkSource will take a moment to reflect on its history-making turn at WDE 2015.

“Ten years ago, we wrote down our goals for the show program and one of them was to get a ribbon at World Dairy Expo,” Ostrom recalled with a laugh. “It is a complete honor to be in this spot with these three cows — a Jersey, a Holstein and a Red & White.

“Right now? We are going to enjoy this moment and thank a lot of people for their good work.”

MilkSource Genetics would like to thank the following team members for helping to achieve this accomplishment: Ryan Krohlow, Joel Keitzman, Francisco Martinez, Travis Schafer, Bertoldo Hernandez, Jose Razo, Katrina Nunes, Savannah Micke, Samatha  Angotti, Grant Vosters and Maddy Gears.
