In 2011, a group of dairy industry individuals decided it was time for the Wisconsin dairy industry to raise funds to help others.  Milk Source -- alongside others like-minded businesses, individuals and organizations -- formed Dairy Cares of Wisconsin.

This year, the 5th Annual Dairy Cares Garden Party reached new heights, bringing in $145,000 to benefit **[Children's Hospital of Wisconsin](http://www.chw.org/)**.  Over its five years, this event has raised more than $450,000 for children facing medical crises.

The 2015 Garden Party took place Aug. 1 at the home of Milk Source Partner Jim Ostrom and his wife, Annette.

The event's organizing committee keeps the garden party’s focus is simple: Bringing friends together to improve the lives of children. The goal is to provide support  with funding for cures of childhood diseases and to help children and parents cope with the pain, stress and worry caused by a serious diagnosis.

“Everyone gathered here is just one degree of separation away from needing — or knowing someone who needed — help from this pioneering medical institution,” Jim Ostrom said during the check presentation. “All of us here — representing all facets of the diary industry — are proud to be able to give something back to an organization as meaningful as Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin.”
