Even in its 13th year, Community Compost Day remains the single-most-popular neighbor outreach event for Milk Source. Despite rain and cold temperatures this year, more than 1,000 vehicle loads of free compost were given out at Rosendale, New Chester and Tidy View dairies.

Despite an official "start time" of 8 a.m., for instance, the first trailers arrived at Tidy View Dairy at 6:55 a.m.

By 8:15 a.m., 103 vehicles had already picked up the organic fertilizer at the farm.

New Chester and Rosendale saw similar enthusiasm from their home communities.

The event represents a big team effort between the Public Affairs Team and the Operations Teams at each dairy. Volunteer organizations -- the Adams-Friendship Powerlifting Club and Boy Scout Troop 623 -- pitch in to support the effort.
