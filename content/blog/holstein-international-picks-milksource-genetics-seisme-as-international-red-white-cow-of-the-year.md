(Oct. 10, 2013) – MilkSource Genetics’ outstanding cow, Blondin Redman Seisme-Red, has done it again.

Seisme has been named International Red and White Cow of the Year by Holstein International, one of the most prestigious honors in the show cow world, for her second time in three years. Seisme also earned the honor in 2011.

That adds to a banner year that began in January when Seisme was selected as the Red & White Cattle Association 2012 Red & White Cow of the Year.

"With are so many incredible Red & Whites in the industry now, to be chosen as the best of the best is humbling. Jamie Endvick and the entire staff of MilkSource Genetics do a wonderful job with our animals and this demonstrates the commitment they have," said Jim Ostrom, one of the partners in MSG.

In selecting Seisme, Holstein International noted that Judge Chad Ryan said, "Seisme is a cow with a perfect combination of dairyness and strength."

Another judge, Attilio Tocchi of Italy, said, "From my perspective Seisme, as a mature cow, is the perfect example of the combination of strength and dairyness. She also has a very special front end."

In 2012, Seisme earned the honor as Grand Champion Red & White Female at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair 2012 in Toronto and was also selected Grand Champion Red & White Female at World Dairy Expo 2012 in Madison, Wis.

Ostrom said, "In less than 12 months, Seisme has earned some of the top awards available, and has earned this honor twice in the last three years. To be recognized like this by those in the industry is more than anyone can hope for."
