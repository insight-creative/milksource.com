Elana is nearing her 12th birthday at Tidy View Dairy and has been a very productive cow. She has produced more than 352,140 lbs. of milk during her lifetime -- about 82 lbs. a day. She has had nine lactations and has had nine calves. She is seen here enjoying a sand bed break with some of her friends. She works so hard that she makes milk, while she's resting.
