Milk Source LLC is a proud sponsor of this year's [Dairy Cares of Wisconsin](https://www.facebook.com/DairyCaresOfWisconsin/) campaign on behalf of Children's Hospital of Wisconsin.

We lent our support (as well as some cows) to both the inaugural "Kickin' It With the Cows" Run/Walk as well as the 7th annual Garden Party, which collectively raised $207,000 to help children and families facing medical crises.

Since its inception in 2011, Dairy Cares has raised $847,000 on behalf of the medical center.

"We are all one degree of separation away from Children's Hospital," said Milk Source Partner Jim Ostrom. "We are proud to stand with so many others from within and outside the dairy industry in supporting this amazing cause."
