Milk Source continued its longstanding support of the&nbsp;**Fox-Wolf Watershed Alliance&nbsp;**with the recent donation of 20 55-gallon barrels for the collection of residential rain water.&nbsp;

They were donated by Tidy View Dairy and delivered thanks to the efforts of driver Juan Castro.

“Using a rain barrel not only benefits local residents but also our local waters. Water stored in a rain barrel and used for watering plants won’t rush off their property and carry pollutants to our streams and rivers,” notes Alyssa Reinke, Northeast Wisconsin Stormwater Consortium Coordinator.&nbsp; “Not only that, water that is used for watering sinks into the ground and replenishes the ground water supply. Two great benefits from one barrel!”&nbsp;

Milk Source Partner Todd Willer has served on the Alliance board of directors for more than a decade.&nbsp;
