MilkSource Genetics was on fire at the 2019 Midwest National Spring Show and added a large stack of blue ribbons, two Junior Champion titles, and two Grand Champion banners to their long list of accomplishments.

In the Red & White show, Miss Apple Snapple — the only red and white cow to be shown by the MilkSource Genetics team — won Grand Champion.

In addition, Sco-Lo-Ar Sid Sangria-ET was the cow to beat in the Holstein Show and rose through the ranks to be named Intermediate and Grand Champion of the Holstein show. Co-Vale Dempsey Dina 4270-ET, owned with Ransom-Rail Farm, followed closely behind Sangria as she was named Senior Champion and Reserve Grand Champion.

With Eddie and Mandi Bue at the helm, the breeding program at MilkSource Genetics is continuing to show its value: Milksource Goldwyn Capri, a daughter of Brackleyfarm Chelios Cheerio, made a splash in the Holstein Show after topping the senior 2-year-old class. Furthermore, Milksource Gentry Marriot-ET and Milksource Gentry Mink-ET, owned with Finco Valparaiso, stole the spotlight in the Jersey show with a Junior Champion and Honorable Mention Junior Champion finish, respectively.

To tip the scales even further, Milksource Zest-ET and Milksource Attica-Red repeated their Jersey herd mates’ success the following day by also taking home the same two titles, respectively, in the Holstein breed.
