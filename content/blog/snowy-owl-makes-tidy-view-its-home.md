[![snowy owl at Tidy View](http://milk-source.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snowy-owl-at-Tidy-View-300x225.jpg)](http://milk-source.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/snowy-owl-at-Tidy-View.jpg)A snowy owl that has called Tidy View home for parts of the last five years has been spending a lot of time around the farm and causing a lot of interest.

It moves around the farm, checking things out and looking for a few tasty morsels near the feed piles and commodity sheds and then finds a nice comfortable spot to perch.

Milk Source's staff environmental coordinator was outside and was fortunate enough to have a camera handy when our owl-friend decided to see who was coming and going from our offices and posed for a portrait.
