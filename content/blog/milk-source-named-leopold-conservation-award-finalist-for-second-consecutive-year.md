For the second consecutive year,  Sand County Foundation, Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation and Wisconsin Land and Water Conservation Association have announced Milk Source LLC is one of three finalists for the prestigious Wisconsin Leopold Conservation Award®, which honors Wisconsin landowner achievement in voluntary stewardship and management of natural resources.

The other honorees are: •David and Leslie Meuer, who own and manage Meuer Farm, LLC, a crop and beef cattle farm in Chilton, received the 2015 Award. •Ronald Brooks, who owns and manages Brooks Dairy Farm, a crop and dairy farm in Waupaca, was also named a finalist.

Given in honor of renowned conservationist Aldo Leopold, the Leopold Conservation Award recognizes extraordinary achievement in voluntary conservation. It inspires other landowners through these examples and provides a visible forum where farmers, ranchers and other private landowners are recognized as conservation leaders. In his influential 1949 book, A Sand County Almanac, Leopold called for an ethical relationship between people and the land they own and manage, which he called “an evolutionary possibility and an ecological necessity.”

"We continue to strive for sustainability in every aspect of our farms," said Jim Ostrom, Milk Source partner. "We are humbled to again be honored with this recognition of our efforts."

The 2015 Leopold Conservation Award, which consists of $10,000 and a crystal depicting Aldo Leopold, will be presented at the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation annual meeting in December.

The Leopold Conservation Award in Wisconsin is made possible through the generous support of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, Wisconsin Land and Water Conservation Association, Wisconsin Energy Foundation, Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, Badgerland Financial, Alliant Energy Foundation, American Transmission Company, DuPont Pioneer, The Mosaic Company and The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.
