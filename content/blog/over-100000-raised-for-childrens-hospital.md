![Dairy-Cares-Color-logo](http://ecbiz137.inmotionhosting.com/~insigh40/milksource.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Dairy-Cares-Color-logo.jpg)KAUKAUNA, Wis. (July 23, 2013) – More than $100,000 was raised by Dairy Cares of Wisconsin at its third annual garden party on Saturday, July 20, for Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin.

The 2013 garden party was a huge success as 300 attendees and other members of the industry raised a grand total of $104,000 this year. Deric DuQuaine of Milk Source, Dairy Cares Board Member and Treasurer, said, “We have many great partners and sponsors in the organization. It was simply amazing to be able to raise over six digits for Children’s Hospital this year.” Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin is located in Milwaukee and also on the Theda Clark Medical Center campus in the Fox Valley.

The Dairy Cares of Wisconsin organization was created in 2011 as an opportunity for members of the dairy industry to come together and offer support to a good cause. Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin has been the event’s chosen beneficiary each year. In 2011, Dairy Cares raised $27,000 for the hospital and then raised $60,000 last year, for a three year grand total of more than $190,000.
