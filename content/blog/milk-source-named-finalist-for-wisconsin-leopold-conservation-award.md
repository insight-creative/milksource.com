The Sand County Foundation and the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Foundation named Milk Source one of three finalists for the prestigious 2014 Wisconsin Leopold Conservation Award®, which honors landowner achievement in voluntary stewardship and management of natural resources.

Given in honor of renowned conservationist Aldo Leopold, the Leopold Conservation Award recognizes extraordinary achievement in voluntary conservation. It inspires other landowners through these examples and provides a visible forum where farmers, ranchers and other private landowners are recognized as conservation leaders. In his influential 1949 book, "A Sand County Almanac," Leopold called for an ethical relationship between people and the land they own and manage, which he called “an evolutionary possibility and an ecological necessity.”

Milk Source wishes to congratulate the winners: Jack and Pat Herricks who, along with their three children and their families, operate a dairy farm in Cashton. We were proud to be finalists alongside David and Leslie Meuer who own and operate Meuer Farm, LLC, a crop and beef cattle farm in Chilton.

The Leopold Conservation Award in Wisconsin is made possible through the generous support of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board, Wisconsin Corn Growers Association, Badgerland Financial, Alliant Energy Foundation, American Transmission Company, DuPont Pioneer, Farm Credit, The Mosaic Company and The Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.
