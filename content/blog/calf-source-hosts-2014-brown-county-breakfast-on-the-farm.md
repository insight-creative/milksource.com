On June 1, 2014, more than 8,000 visitors converged on Calf Source for the 2014 Brown County Breakfast on the Farm.

The event offered a celebration of agriculture, offering visitors an opportunity to view the Milk Source operation up close. In addition to enjoying a homemade breakfast of ham and cheese omelets, sausage links, cheese and yogurt, families were able to explore the petting zoo, play in bouncy houses, tour the farm on a tractor and wagon, mingle with a variety of farm animals as well as participate in many other activities.

“So few of us left in farming,” Jim Ostrom, Milk Source co-partner told the Green Bay Press-Gazette, noting there were 150,000 dairy farmers in Wisconsin after the second World War, but fewer than 10,000 today.

“I think it’s important people understand how food is produced,” he said. “And they understand modern agriculture is doing an essential job. We need our communities to understand the critical role that area farmers play in food production, in feeding the world, and feeding Northeastern Wisconsin.

“We need some understanding, and I think the way to do that is to show them your farm.”

Visitors included Alice in Dairyland, several state Fairest of the Fairs, "Addie the Cow" and others.

“I grew up on a third-generation family dairy farm, and now my daughter, she doesn’t have that opportunity,” said Sarah Englebert, Brown County Dairy Promotion coordinator. “These kinds of events are important to bring people out, you can bring people who may not always have the opportunity to come out to the farm. Not only can you tour the farm, but you can sit and eat an ice cream or drink a glass of milk while look at those cows. You can’t do that every day in the city.”
