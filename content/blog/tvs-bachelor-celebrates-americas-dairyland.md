Milk Source is excited to see the cast of ABC's "The Bachelor" celebrating Wisconsin's Dairy heritage in the Jan. 23 episode. Among the dairy operations that will be spotlighted are the **[LaClare Farms](http://www.laclarefarm.com/)** in Malone and Knigge Farm in Omro.

That's LaClare's award-winning cheesemaker Katie Fuhrmann and Business Manager Greg Hedrich posing with this season's most-eligible male, Milwaukee's **[Nick Viall](https://www.facebook.com/TheBachelor/?fref=ts)**. 

The Hedrich family -- the multi-generational farm family that operates LaClare -- was kind enough to share their press release with us:

MALONE, WI — LaClare Farms will make a unique cameo appearance on the Jan. 23 episode of ABC’s popular dating show, “The Bachelor.” Building on the fact that this season’s most-eligible-male, Nick Viall, is from Wisconsin, the show is highlighting the state’s reputation as “America’s Dairyland.” The show filmed its “group date” segment at Knigge Farms in Omro where the ladies vying for his heart competed in a race, featuring a 10-lb. wheel of LaClare’s U.S. Cheese Championship-winning Evalon. “Trust me, running after the wheel is fun, but eating it is a whole lot better,” beamed Katie Fuhrmann, LaClare’s cheesemaker, who was on hand when they filmed the segment. She, along with LaClare Business Manager Greg Hedrich, enjoyed meeting the producers, Viall and some of the contestants during the filming. “They certainly picked a great artisan cheese for lovers to share,” Hedrich said. “We use the freshest, highest-quality and most delicious goat milk from does fed on grain and top-tier forage. The result is a Gouda-style semi-soft treat with just a hint of Italian Asiago flavor and texture. The producers chose well on this one.” Fuhrmann won the Best of Show with LaClare’s Evalon out of 1,604 cheeses at the U.S. Cheese Championship. “There is no better place in the world for cheese production than Wisconsin,” Fuhrmann said. “And we’re very excited that ABC chose LaClare Farms to represent the industry. We are really looking forward to watch the Jan. 23 episode, just like everyone else.”
