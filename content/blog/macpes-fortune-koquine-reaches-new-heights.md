Holstein Association USA has boosted Macpes Fortune Koquine to a 95-point classification.

This puts Koquine among rarified company. Among her MilkSource Genetics' sisters, only Cherrycrest lyster Golden and Luck-E Dundee Jenna have achieved that level; and Blondin Redman Seisme has reached 96.

"MilkSource Genetics and its team of dedicated employee’s work hard to care for every animal to reach her full potential," said Jamie Endvick, MilkSource Genetics' herd manager.

The Holstein Association's professional staff of classifiers evaluates 17 individual traits in five major dairy scorecard breakdowns. "Information received from classification can be used to make important mating decisions, identify the most profitable and valuable animals in your herd, and adds definite marketability to Registered Holsteins," according to the association.

"Jamie and his team at MilkSource have done a terrific job with developing Koquine," said John Vosters, MilkSource co-partner. "The feeding and daily care program were integral in her developing into a 95-point cow."

The score adds more luster to an already notable career for Koquine (Sire:  To-Mar-Fortune-ET; Dam: Duhovent Talent Klody EX-91-2E-CAN; MGD: Duhovent Allen Klodio)

Her honors include:

• 2nd Six Year Old+, Midwest National Spring Show 2014 • All-Canadian Four Year Old, 2012 • 1st Four Year Old, Royal Winter Fair, 2012 • Grand Champion, Rimouski, 2012 • 1st Four Year Old, QC Expo, 2012
