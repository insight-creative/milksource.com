Sept. 16, 2014 – History was made today at MilkSource Genetics. Blondin Redman Seisme-Red is the first classified EX-97 Red & White Holstein cow ever.

Holstein Association USA upgraded her classification to the extremely rare and extraordinary EX-97 (MS-99). Only 29 cows ever have reached this pinnacle, all of which were Black & Whites, according to DairyCowDaily.

“Seisme has been a special cow from day one,” said Jim Ostrom, MSG co-partner. “It has been a privilege for Herd Manager Jamie Endvick and the entire team at MilkSource Genetics to work with, and care for, such an extraordinary beauty.”

To put the win into context, Cy Letter, technical superviwor for Holstein Association USA, explained, “There have been about 200 million cows in the history of modern breeding, and Seisme is No. 30 to reach this level. She is also the first-ever Red & White cow.”

In 2013, Seisme was International Red and White Cow of the Year by Holstein International, one of the most prestigious honors in the show cow world.

“Seisme is a work of wonder for Mother Nature, but we’re very proud of all the men and women at MilkSource Genetics who work behind the scenes to take care of her,” said John Vosters, MSG co-partner. “These are people who are passionate about their cows. It’s not a job to them — it’s a passion.”
