Grand Marsh, Wis. (August 17, 2012) – Milk Source and Clean Energy North America, LLC, (CENA) have announced they have reached an agreement that will allow CENA to build a biodigester at a Milk Source dairy in Wisconsin.

“This is a partnership that will lead to even more environmentally friendly farming and a sustainable flow of green energy from the dairy,” said Jim Ostrom, partner in Milk Source. “We have been working with CENA toward an agreement for a digester since our company first announced plans for this dairy – even before we broke ground.”

Murray Sim of CENA said, “Our agreement with will allow us to construct a true state-of-the-art digester on the farm which will take advantage of the valuable gasses in the manure from the cows and turn it into much-needed energy. The dairy has a very advanced manure treatment facility which allows the opportunity for one of the -- if not the -- premier biodigesters in the state and country.”

Ostrom pointed out another benefit of the digester. “When a 3,300 cow dairy farm installed a digester in its area, the town of Rantoul in Calumet County sent a letter to the Town of Gibson that stated: ‘The digester setup, which has been constructed at this site, has virtually eliminated all manure odors.’ ” He said the digester and the lagoon cover specially designed for New Chester Dairy will help minimize odors dramatically.

Ostrom also cited a report on digesters from the non-profit National Resources Defense Council found “Air quality improves significantly because the biodigester reduces the smell of manure, turning its volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into odorless methane and carbon dioxide. Hydrogen sulfide, the source of the "rotten egg" odor, is captured in the biogas and destroyed.”

CENA’s Sim added that the digester at the dairy will include a hydrogen-sulfide scrubber that will further protect the environment.

It is important to note that the digester, in general, uses only the gasses from the manure and does not destroy the vital farming nutrients that are found in manure that is used as organic fertilizer. “Our farming partners will still be able to use our organic nutrients on their fields, replacing the need for chemical fertilizer,” Ostrom said.

Construction of the digester is expected to begin in late fall 2012 after the Wisconsin department of Natural Resources and others approve the needed permits and construction is expected to be done by early summer of 2013, weather permitting.
