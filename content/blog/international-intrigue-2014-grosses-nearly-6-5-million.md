When MilkSource Genetics agreed to host International Intrigue in July 2014, we knew it was going to be big. We never fathomed it would be THIS big though. The event grossed $6,435,800 – based on 123 head with an average price of $52,323.

Sale Coordinator Jeff Butler pledged the event would offer “the greatest collection of animals to have ever been assembled for one sale,” and it turns out he wasn’t exaggerating.

Among the high-performing cows, MilkSource Genetic’s Vedderlea Goldwin Esther, holding the prestigious Lot No. 1
