For nearly 15 years, Milk Source has partnered with the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers to celebrate June Dairy Month.

The Class-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers (temporarily) transforms into the “Wisconsin Udder Tuggers,” complete with cow-and-farmer-themed jerseys, logos and promotions. It's among the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://hoards.com/article-30550-an-udderly-exciting-weekend.html"><strong>most-popular home-game stretches</strong></a>&nbsp;of the year within the entire Minor League Baseball system.

Milk Source not only sponsors an annual giveaway but has become a fan favorite by bringing a show cow and calves to mingle with the crowd. For many attendees, it's the first time they've seen a bovine in their lives.&nbsp;

“De-mystifying agriculture for modern consumers is critical,” says Avi Stern, Milk Source director of public affairs. “Most of these fans have never stepped foot on a farm, so this is a way to bring a little bit of the farm to them.”

Wisconsin's 75th Alice in Dairyland, Taylor Schaefer, also joined the Milk Source crew for one night – successfully tossing the official “first pitch” and then chugging a chocolate milk to drive home the theme of the day.
