Expanding the international profile of three highly awarded Jersey cows, MilkSource Genetics has announced an ownership partnership with Fernando Jarquin of Finco Valparaiso & Productos Valparaiso in Guatemala.

They will share ownership of [**Edgebrook Tequila Madison**](https://bit.ly/2NVvt4F) and her winning two Gentry daughters, Marriot (1st Fall Calf & Junior Champion of the 2018 International Jersey Show at World Dairy Expo) and Mink (2nd Fall Calf).

The partnership broadens on an existing relationship forged in 2017 for the legendary **[Musqie Iatola Martha EX-97](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Musqie-Iatola-Martha-EX-97/p/41372473/category=3514356)**.

“We are excited to work with Fernando again,” said Jim Ostrom, MilkSource Genetics partner. "With his participation, the global exposure for these three amazing cows is poised to grow significantly."
