Dairy Cares of Wisconsin is seeking businesses and individuals to join in supporting fundraising efforts for their chosen cause, Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin.

Over the last four years, Dairy Cares’ generous sponsors and donors have collectively raised over $300,000. This gift to the hospital’s general fund on behalf of the dairy community and its supporting industries represents a heart-felt commitment to positively impacting Wisconsin children and their families who seek the medical excellence provided at the renowned pediatric care center during the toughest of times.

Giving back in this way is a calling that dairy producers like Jim Ostrom have answered. “In Wisconsin, we are blessed with being the best place in the country to milk cows and do business,” explains the co-‐founder of Dairy Cares (and co-founder of Milk Source). “Many of us have had success, and we want to give it back.”

The Dairy Cares committee selected Children’s Hospital as their recipient because of its broad reach. Headquartered in Milwaukee, the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin provides statewide care through 40 different locations. These various sites provide a range of specialized services, from dealing with childhood terminal illness and cancer to psychological disorders. Experts in premature birth, the neonatal intensive care unit is ranked top in the nation.

“Nearly everyone we have met has an experience of somebody they know who was touched by the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin and how they care for young children who are ill,” Ostrom adds.

As Dairy Cares approaches its fifth year, the non-­‐profit organization invites businesses and individuals to join this cause. Sponsoring partners receive event recognition for their tax-­‐deductible gift during the annual garden party, which is set for Aug. 1 at the home of Jim and Annette Ostrom, De Pere, Wis.

“All of us here in Wisconsin are part of the dairy industry in some way, and so many of us have been personally touched by Children’s Hospital,” Ostrom says. “We invite our friends from the dairy community and beyond to pledge their support and demonstrate just how much dairy truly does care about the children and families of Wisconsin.”
