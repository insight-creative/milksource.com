Milk Source's annual Community Compost Day brought more than 600 friends and neighbors to farms in Wisconsin and Michigan.

Hosted at New Chester, Rosendale and Tidy View dairies in Wisconsin as well as Hudson Dairy in Michigan, the event allows serious gardeners and yard workers access to free compost. 

"We try to time it so that those Mother's Day Gardens reap the most benefits," said Bill Harke, Milk Source's director of public affairs. "The event is a great way to extend our focus on sustainability deeper into some of our home communities." 

Harke thanked all the team members, family and friends as well as local volunteers who faced down some unseasonably cool temperatures to ensure the giveaway went smoothly. 

"We had a great team behind a great event," he said. "And we're looking forward to doing it again in 2018."
