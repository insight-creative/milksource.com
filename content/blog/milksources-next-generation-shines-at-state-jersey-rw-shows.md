A pair of Gentry daughters out of Madison staked their claim at the Wisconsin Championship Jersey Show, spearheading a strong group of MilkSource Genetics' youngsters who took to the show ring.

Milksource Gentry **Mink**\-ET and Milksource Gentry **Marriot** were Junior Champion and Res. Junior Champion, respectively, along with their 1st and 2nd place finishes in the Fall Calf class.

Meanwhile, Milksource Premier **Boston** was named Res. Junior Champion of the Junior Show and 1st Spring Yearling.

Ultimately, Mink, Marriot and Boston combined to bring in the Junior Best 3 Females award as well.

The future looked equally positive at the Wisconsin Championship Red & White Show, where Milksource Addic **Tipper**\-RED won 1st Spring Heifer Calf.

Veteran competitor -- Frozenes-LP Contdr **Lark**\-RED -- showed the youngsters how it was done by snagging the 1st 5 Yr Old class. Lark is co-owned with our friends at Crescentmead.
