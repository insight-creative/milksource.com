Run or walk the 1 mile, 5K or 10K along the scenic Fox River. The Course starts at Voyageur Park, then quickly onto the Fox River Trail and crosses the DePere Bridge on the mighty Fox River. It goes through St. Norbert’s College Campus then back to the park incorporating the Fox River Pier for a beautiful panoramic view.

The 10k continues down Lost Dauphin Road and winds through the new St. Norbert’s Football Stadium and then back to Voyageur Park. Flat fast course. All miles will be marked and turns will be well marked. Plenty of water stations along the course.

Cows will be at the finish where you can stop mooving and they can do the mooing. This is a chip-timed event. Performance moisture wicking shirt will be provided for each participant. Plenty of food at the end too. Awards to the overall winners and in separate age groups.

Come support a great cause and potentially set a PR on a fun course. Proceeds benefit Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin.
