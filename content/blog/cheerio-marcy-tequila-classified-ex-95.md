MilkSource Genetics is ending 2015 on a high note -- three of them, actually.

A trio of dynamicÂ cows -- **[Strans-Jen-D Tequila-RED-ET](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Strans-Jen-D-Tequila-Red-ET-EX-94/p/40102059/category=3514356)** along with **[Brackleyfarm Chelios Cheerio](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Brackleyfarm-Chelios-Cheerio-EX-94/p/17155503/category=3514356)** and **[Charwill Attic Marcy](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Charwill-Attic-Marcy-EX-94/p/50612469/category=3514356)** -- are all newly classified EX-95.

"Our team works hard every day to take care of these wonderful cows," said MilkSource Genetics Herd Manager Jamie Endvick. "We appreciate how rare it is to achieve such an amazing result. I'm very proud of everyone who is involved on our team.

"It's a new day and we'll continue doing what we're doing in our effort to achieve great results."
