Living up to her sire’s name, **Antia Absolute Joline** stole the spotlight at the The Royal Agricultural Winter Fair’s 2018 Red and White Show.

In an exciting victory, Joline — with Jim Ostrom on the halter — continued her winning ways and was named Grand and Intermediate Champion. Earlier in the day, she quickly rose to the top of her class and was named 1st Place and Best Udder of the Junior Three Year Old’s.

While her achievements at The Royal were exciting for the MilkSource Genetics team, Joline’s appearance in the ring was extra special this time around: She was the only Red and White Holstein to be shown-and-owned by MilkSource Genetics during this year’s fair.

Joline adds these accomplishments to a long list of titles, banners and ribbons on her show record. Most recently, she was named Honorable Mention Intermediate Champion and 2nd Place Junior Three Year Old Cow at the International Red and White Show during World Dairy Expo. Prior to her tenure with MilkSource Genetics, she was the cow to beat at the 2018 Supreme Dairy Show in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada, and took home coveted Grand Champion title.

She leads off a fantastic group of leading ladies that make up the MilkSource Genetics show string at The Royal, including fan favorites, Holsteins TK-Plainview Ripley and Weeks Dundee Anika and Jerseys Milksource Gentry Mink-ET and Milksource Premier Boston.
