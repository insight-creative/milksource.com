[Musqie Iatola Martha](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Musqie-Iatola-Martha-EX-94/p/41372473/category=3514356), who has won three consecutive Supreme Champion titles at the World Dairy Expo and The Royal Winter Agricultural Fair, has added to her growing list of accomplishments.

She is newly classified as EX-96, the first Jersey cow in the MilkSource Genetics herd to achieve such heights.

"Martha has tremendous style and balance throughout," said John Vosters, MilkSource Genetics partner. "She is long from nose to tail and walks on a wonderful set of feet and legs. But her incredible mammary system is her calling card that enables her to consistently top her competition. With an extremely high and wide rear udder, a long smoothly attached fore udder, a strong center crease and terrific udder quality, she is truly second to none right now."

Martha was named Supreme Champion of The Royal during both the 2015 and 2016 shows. In between, she garnered the same honor at the 2016 World Dairy Expo.Â Martha was named a unanimous All-American and All-Canadian Cow in both 2015 and 2016, as well.

Martha joins elite company in the MilkSource Genetics herd where [Blondin Redman Seisme](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Blondin-Redman-Seisme-EX-97/p/15014439/category=3514356) (a Red & White) reached EX-97 and [Lovhill Goldwyn Katrysha](http://milk-source.local/milksource-genetics/great-cows/#!/Lovhill-Goldwyn-Katrysha-EX-96/p/45867144/category=3514356) (Holstein) preceded her to the EX-96 classification.

"Martha is a beautiful cow," said Jim Ostrom, MilkSource Genetics partner. "She's a born champion who continues to display the disposition and qualities that make her stand out among some of the most amazing animals in the world."
