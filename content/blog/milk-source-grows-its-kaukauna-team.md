Milk Source LLC has announced the addition of four professionals to its Kaukauna-based staff:

\--  **Trudy Krueger** as executive assistant. She brings more than 25 years of administrative experience from a variety of corporations.

\--  **Matt Wichman** as director of agronomy. As an agri-business specialist, he has worked in a variety of capacities, most recently with DuPont Pioneer.

\--  **Avi Stern** as communications manager. He most recently served on the marketing team at Goodwill NCW and brings more than a decade as a newspaper journalist covering northeast Wisconsin.

\--  **Linda Sell** as accounts payable specialist. She joins the team with more than 20 years accounts payable experience from multi-location companies.

“We like to talk about bringing people ‘back to dairy.’” said Jim Ostrom, Milk Source co-partner. “They may be new to our field, but they are experts in their own fields. We see the value in seeking out the best-fitting professionals and integrating them into our own operation.”

Milk Source has four dairy farms in Wisconsin, plus a calf-raising facility and a show cow barn. In addition, the company has a heifer farm in Kansas and recently purchased three dairy farms in Michigan. In January, it was named Dairy Today’s Innovative Dairy Farm of the Year for 2014.
