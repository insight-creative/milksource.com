Wisconsin Manufacturing & Commerce has awarded Milk Source with the 2022&nbsp;<br>Business Friend of the Environment Award for its efforts in fostering<br>environmental stewardship (WMC is the leading business advocacy organization<br>in the state).

Milk Source previously won the award in 2014 in the “Sustainability”&nbsp;<br>category.

Among the initiatives that impressed the judges were the conversion<br>of all farms to energy-efficient LED lighting; installing energy-saving&nbsp;<br>electric-drive fan motors; intensifying our LEAN management program as well as<br>implementing other agricultural “best practices” that support &nbsp;soil and water<br>health for current and future generations.

“Wisconsin’s economy depends on&nbsp;<br>industry leaders who go above and beyond to use sustainable and environmentally friendly business practices,” said WMC Director of Environmental & Energy Policy Craig Summerfield (pictured alongside Milk Source’s Jim Ostrom).&nbsp;<br>
