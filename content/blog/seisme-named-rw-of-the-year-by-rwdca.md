(Jan. 22, 2013) – The honors continued for MilkSource Genetics’ prized cow, Blondin Redman Seisme-Red, as the Red & White Cattle Association announced today that Seisme has been selected as the 2012 Red & White Cow of the Year.

"MilkSource Genetics is overwhelmed to have this incredible cow given this most prestigious award," said Jim Ostrom, one of the partners in MilkSource Genetics. “There are so many excellent Red & Whites being shown that to be selected as the best of the best is a true honor and a tremendous compliment to Jamie Endvick and the entire staff of MilkSource Genetics.”

In November, Seisme earned the honor as Grand Champion Red & White Female at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair 2012 in Toronto and was also honored as the top Female Mature Cow and won the Top Production award as well.

In October, Seisme, was selected Grand Champion Red & White Female at World Dairy Expo 2012 in Madison, Wis., and was also honored for Best Udder in the Red & White show.

Ostrom said, "No one can ever anticipate having one of its animals have a year like this, but Seisme is truly special. To be honored like this by those in the industry is more than anyone can hope for."

The RWDCA was established in 1964, based on the principles of an open herdbook and the bloodlines of the Red Holstein. Nearly fifty years later, the RWDCA is a strong and growing organization. The breed publication, The Red Bloodlines, links the membership and keeps them informed. Subscribers in over 20 countries receive the latest news on Red & Whites.

The RWDCA strives to encourage and promote the progressive breeding and development of superior Red & White Dairy Cattle by providing breeders with information, programs and services to help track, evaluate and improve the breed from one generation to the next.
