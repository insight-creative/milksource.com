Milk SourceÂ  founders -- John Vosters, Todd Willer and Jim Ostrom \-- have been named World Dairy Expo's 2020 "Dairy Producers of the Year."

They are among honorees being recognized "for instrumental contributions to the dairy industry and their communities."

The trio's ongoing commitment to sustainability -- measured in environmental stewardship, top-shelf animal care and community engagement -- continues to drive the success of their farms.

"We are humbled," Ostrom said. "This award really extends to all our team members, who show up every day and take pride in looking out for our cows, our neighbors and one another."
