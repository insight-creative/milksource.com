## Leading the way in modern sustainable agriculture

Milk Source was co-founded in 1994 by UW-Madison graduates Jim Ostrom, John Vosters and Todd Willer — each from multi-generational Wisconsin farm families — and traces its roots back to 1965 when a small 30-cow dairy farm was started in Freedom by John’s parents.

Milk Source operates quality dairies in Wisconsin and the Midwest, producing milk that is used to make cheese, butter and other dairy products. In addition, Milk Source also has a Wisconsin calf farm and a Kansas heifer-raising facility. We are leaders in modern sustainable agriculture, finding safe, reliable and expandable technologies that tie economic success with environmental stewardship. Our farms have been pace-setters in the use of technology such as sand recycling, manure separation and underground nutrient pipelines.

As a result of commitments like these, Milk Source earned World Dairy Expo’s 2020 “Dairy Producers of the Year” recognition for its efforts to expand sustainability throughout the industry. Milk Source also was named Dairy Today’s Innovative Dairy Farmer of the Year for 2014, Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce’s 2014 and 2022 Business Friend of the Environment awards winner, Wisconsin Family Business Council’s 2015 “Innovation & Sustainability” Award winner, the 2015 Zoetis Diversity and Inclusion Award winner, a 2016 Wisconsin Top Rural Development Initiative Award winner and one of three finalists for the 2014 and 2015 Wisconsin Leopold Conservation Awards.

Our offices are located at N3569 Vanden Bosch Road, Kaukauna.
